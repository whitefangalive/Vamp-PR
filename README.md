# Vamp-PR
As a vampire you have always hated the negative stereotypes that your species gets.  You arenâ€™t evil maybe just a little bloodthirsty. In order to save your reputation you can help citizens and do good deeds. Rush through the city dodging garlic and doing good deeds to rack up points all before the sun inevitably rises.
